       "    \"I have a vacation house in the mountains that I live in during summer. I made some serious mistakes when I bought this house and I should have known better. I bought next to an empty parcel (there are lots in this neighborhood) and I assumed the other neighbors would remain the same. I also didn't study the neighborhood in good weather where everyone lives outside and in everyone else's business.\\n\\n**This lot has zero privacy.** It's tucked back away from the street so I have a large front yard and a small backyard. Naturally most of my time is spent in the front yard. Both neighbors' main social patios face directly into my front yard. One also has a second floor balcony they are constantly on and their kitchen area is on the second floor and so when I am in my driveway they literally look down at me (it was a vacation home when I bought). I have some trees, but with each wind event, the trees are falling. I constantly feel watched, and I know that I am, because the neighbors bring up things they see me do.\\n\\nOf course to make matters much worse, the empty lot out back was built on and the people are constantly in their backyard and feel fewer than 20 feet away from me even when I am inside the house. This past summer I built a wooden fence with deep stakes and concrete for about $3000, to block them out. Since this is the mountains, there is a lot of wind and we tried to protect against that. When I woke up this morning, I saw that my $3000 was flushed down the toilet. The fence was completely destroyed. As soon as I saw it, I said we were packing up and leaving. This was pretty much the last straw. When we arrived last night (we stayed less than 24 hours), the garage was completely destroyed by a family of mice. This house has constant bad luck.\\n\\nI have zero privacy, I am completely exposed. I tried to fix that with the fence, and I can't even have that. I feel like my only option here is to sell this house and look for a larger lot. Is there anything else worth trying if I decide to throw away another $3000 for a fence?

I am trying to decide if I should send this thing back within 14 days (opened) and eat the 15% restocking fee, or keep it. I am trying to read through all of the discussions on the difference between the two and figured I would just lay out my use case and ask for help. \\n\\nRight now, I have two of the 8-port 60W PoE switches, one for the west side of the house, and one for the east side. They would both be plugged into the UDMP via CAT6. All of the access points are connected to the PoE switches. For the most part, the two wings of the house are isolated except for printing and an occasional large file transfer... with one exception. I have an NVR on the East side that always replicates data to a ZoneMinder server on the west side, and I might want to put these onto a VLAN at some point. My Internet connection is 400Mbps with no hope of going above 1Gbps; however, my vacation home which currently has a UDM Pro *does* have a 1Gbps fiber link that might be upgraded at some point, so perhaps it\\'s useful.\\n\\nIt sounds like cross LAN traffic is not an issue with the backplane, but inter VLAN traffic might be bottlenecked as will traffic that originates from both sides of the house simultaneously to the Internet/WAN. I am guessing this might be an issue when I am working in the west side, and my family is watching YouTube TV and using the wifi on the east side. \\n\\nReasons why I feel icky with the UDMP:\\n\\n* It has 8 ports and I am only using 2. I *could* use more of the ports if they had PoE, for my PiHole and some other devices that I feel (perhaps incorrectly) should be \"closer to the Internet\" rather than off one of the switches, like my two servers.\\n* I am already wasting so much money on this thing that has an NVR that I won\\'t even use. If I am going to do that, I might as well try to maximize usage of the ports.\\n\\nReasons why I feel icky with the UDMPSE:\\n\\n* It\\'s $120 more (plus the restocking fee and the possibility that I might have to pay to ship it back and then also pay to have the UDMPSE shipped) for the same wasted NVR, and still wasting a decent number of ports. \\n* I may need PoE+. I don\\'t know.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear if some of my concerns are not technically sound. Should I stick with the UDMP, or is the SE that much better?')],\n",
